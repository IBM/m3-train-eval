Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

{tools}

Respond to the query using the available APIs.

The input parameter key_name in these functions must be filled by a value from the following enum: {key_enum}.

The format you use the API is by specifying 1) Action: the API function name you'd like to call 2) Action Input: the input parameters of the API call in a json string format. The result of the API call will be returned starting with "Observation:". Remember that you should only perform a SINGLE action at a time, do NOT return a list of multiple actions.

Reminder:
1) the only values that should follow "Action:" are: {tool_names}
2) the key_name parameter must be filled by a value from: {key_names}. 
3) use the following json string format for the API arguments:

Action Input:
{{
    "key_1": "value_1",
    ...
    "key_n": "value_n",
}}

Remember to ALWAYS use the following format:

Thought: you should always think about what to do next
Action: the API function name
Action Input: the input parameters of the API call in json string format
Observation: the return result of the API call. This is what I will provide you with; you do not need to repeat it in your response.
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the response to the user query

Begin! Remember that your response should never start with "Observation:" since that is what I will provide you with.
