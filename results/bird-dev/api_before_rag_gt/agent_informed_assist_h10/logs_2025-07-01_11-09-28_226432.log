The exact cause of RA is unknown, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Symptoms of RA can vary from person to person, but they often include joint pain, stiffness, swelling, and fatigue.

The system simplifies the traditional Chinese characters by reducing the number of strokes and simplifying the forms of a large number of characters. This makes it easier to learn and write. Chinese Simplified is also used in the People's Republic of China's official documents and publications.

The user is asking about the purpose of introducing the language of the "Battlebond" set. I have retrieved the information that Chinese Simplified is one of the languages available for the "Battlebond" set. The purpose of introducing Chinese Simplified is to increase literacy rates in China by simplifying the traditional Chinese characters, making them easier to learn and write. Therefore, I can infer that the purpose of introducing Chinese Simplified in the "Battlebond" set is to make the game more accessible to players who speak that language.
