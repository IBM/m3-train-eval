- `top_k`: `do_sample` is set to `False`. However, `top_k` is set to `20` -- this flag is only used in sample-based generation modes. You should set `do_sample=True` or unset `top_k`.
If you're using a pretrained model, note that some of these attributes may be set through the model's `generation_config.json` file.
