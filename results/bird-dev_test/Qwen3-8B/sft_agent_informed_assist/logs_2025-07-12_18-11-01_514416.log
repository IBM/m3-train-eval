Min began his professional career in 2015 with the South Korean club Suwon Samsung Bluewings, where he quickly made a name for himself as a promising young player. In 2019, he transferred to Sampdoria, becoming the first South Korean player to ever play for the club. Despite his small stature, standing at just 5'6\", Min has proven to be a formidable force on the field, with his quick footwork and precise finishing skills. He has been praised by coaches and teammates alike for his work ethic and dedication to the sport."

Serra Angel is a 4/4 Flying creature, which means it has four power and four toughness, and it can only be blocked by creatures with flying or reach. The card's artwork, created by artist Douglas Shuler, depicts a beautiful angel with white wings and a golden halo. The angel is holding a sword and shield, ready for battle. Serra Angel is a popular choice among players due to its high power and toughness, as well as its flying ability."

It was introduced in the 1950s and 1960s as part of a language reform to increase literacy rates in China. The system simplifies the traditional Chinese characters by reducing the number of strokes and simplifying the forms of a large number of characters. This makes it easier to learn and write. Chinese Simplified is also used in the People's Republic of China's official documents and publications. Despite its name, Chinese Simplified is not a language itself, but a writing system used to write the Chinese language."

This condition can occur in both superficial and deep veins, with the latter being more serious due to the risk of the clot dislodging and traveling to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. Symptoms of thrombophlebitis include pain, swelling, redness, and warmth in the affected area. Risk factors for developing thrombophlebitis include prolonged immobility, surgery, pregnancy, and certain medical conditions such as cancer and autoimmune disorders. Treatment for thrombophlebitis typically involves the use of blood thinners and compression stockings to prevent the formation of additional clots and reduce swelling. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the clot."
