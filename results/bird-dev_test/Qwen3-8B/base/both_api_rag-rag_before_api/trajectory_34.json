        "thought": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking about the proportion of patients with thrombocytopenia who were diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. First, I need to understand the key terms here. Thrombocytopenia refers to a low platelet count, which can be a sign of various conditions. The disease in question is one where the immune system attacks the body's own cells and tissues, which sounds like an autoimmune disease, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nThe user wants the proportion, so I need to find two numbers: the total number of patients with thrombocytopenia and the number of those patients diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. Then, divide the latter by the former to get the proportion.\n\nLooking at the available APIs, there's get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc_v1... but that's for WBC ranges. Wait, maybe get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc isn't the right one. Let me check again. There's get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc_v1_bird_thrombosis_prediction_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc_get which requires diagnosis, wbc min, and max. Not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, there's get_patient_diagnosis_lab_date_v1... which gives diagnosis and lab date by patient ID. But without a patient ID, that might not help directly. Maybe I need to find patients with thrombocytopenia first. Thrombocytopenia is related to platelet counts, so perhaps looking for patients with low platelet counts (PLT). There's get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_v1... which counts patients with PLT ranges and non-null diagnosis. That might be useful. \n\nWait, the user is asking about the disease that causes the immune system to attack the body's own cells and tissues. That's an autoimmune disease. So, the diagnosis would be something like 'Autoimmune Disease' or specific conditions like 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)', etc. But the exact diagnosis might vary. However, the API functions might not have a specific parameter for autoimmune diseases. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the diagnosis is specified as 'Autoimmune' or similar. Let me check the APIs again. There's get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc, but that's for WBC. Maybe the diagnosis parameter can be set to 'Autoimmune' if that's an option. However, without knowing the exact diagnosis codes, this could be tricky. \n\nAnother approach: the user might be referring to a specific diagnosis like 'SLE' or 'RA'. Let's assume that the diagnosis is 'SLE' for this example. Then, I can use the get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc API to find patients with that diagnosis and a PLT range indicating thrombocytopenia. But I need to determine the PLT thresholds for thrombocytopenia. Typically, thrombocytopenia is defined as platelets < 150,000/\u00b5L. So, setting the PLT min to 0 and max to 150,000. \n\nWait, but the API get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_v1_bird_thrombosis_prediction_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_get requires plt_min and plt_max. So, if I set plt_min to 0 and plt_max to 150, that would capture patients with thrombocytopenia. Then, the diagnosis parameter would be 'Autoimmune' or the specific disease. However, without knowing the exact diagnosis codes, this is uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the diagnosis is 'Autoimmune' and the PLT range is used to filter. But the API might not have a direct way to link PLT with diagnosis. Another thought: perhaps the get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc API can be used with the diagnosis as 'Autoimmune' and WBC range, but that's not directly related to thrombocytopenia. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to first find all patients with thrombocytopenia (using PLT thresholds) and then check their diagnoses. But the APIs available don't directly allow for that. Wait, there's get_patient_diagnosis_lab_date_v1... which gives diagnosis and lab date by patient ID. But without patient IDs, that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_v1... API can be used with a specific diagnosis. For example, if the diagnosis is 'Autoimmune', then the count would be the number of patients with that diagnosis and PLT in the thrombocytopenia range. Then, the total number of patients with thrombocytopenia would be the count from get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis with diagnosis as 'All' or something similar. But the API might not have a 'All' option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis API can be called with diagnosis as an empty string or a wildcard, but the parameters require specific values. This is a bit of a dead end. \n\nWait, perhaps the user is referring to a specific diagnosis like 'SLE' or 'RA', which are autoimmune diseases. Let's assume the diagnosis is 'SLE'. Then, the steps would be:\n\n1. Find the number of patients with SLE and thrombocytopenia (PLT < 150,000).\n2. Find the total number of patients with thrombocytopenia (regardless of diagnosis).\n3. Divide the first number by the second to get the proportion.\n\nBut how to get these numbers using the available APIs. For step 1, use get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis with diagnosis 'SLE' and PLT range. For step 2, use get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis with diagnosis as a wildcard or all. However, the API might not support wildcards. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc API can be used with diagnosis as 'SLE' and WBC range, but that's not directly related. \n\nThis seems challenging. Maybe the correct approach is to use the get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis API with diagnosis as 'Autoimmune' (if that's a valid diagnosis code) and PLT thresholds. But without knowing the exact diagnosis codes, this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is derived from the get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc API with diagnosis as 'Autoimmune' and WBC range, but again, not directly related to thrombocytopenia. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to use the get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis API with a specific diagnosis (like 'SLE') and PLT thresholds, and then find the total thrombocytopenia patients using another API. However, without knowing the exact diagnosis codes, this might not be accurate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is found using the get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc API with diagnosis as 'Autoimmune' and WBC range, but this is not directly related to thrombocytopenia. \n\nThis is quite complex. Maybe the user is referring to a specific API that can provide the required data. Let me check the list again. \n\nWait, there's get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc_v1_bird_thrombosis_prediction_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc_get which requires diagnosis, wbc_min, and wbc_max. But thrombocytopenia is about platelets, not WBC. So that's not helpful. \n\nAnother thought: the get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_v1_bird_thrombosis_prediction_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_get API requires plt_min and plt_max, and diagnosis. So, if I set plt_min to 0 and plt_max to 150 (assuming units are 10^3/\u00b5L), and diagnosis as 'Autoimmune', that would give the count of patients with autoimmune disease and thrombocytopenia. Then, the total thrombocytopenia patients would be the same API with diagnosis as empty or all. But the API might not support that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total thrombocytopenia patients can be found by calling the same API with diagnosis as a wildcard, but the parameters require specific values. \n\nThis is getting too stuck. Maybe the answer is that the proportion is calculated by dividing the number of patients with autoimmune disease and thrombocytopenia by the total number of patients with thrombocytopenia. To get these numbers, use the get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis API with diagnosis as 'Autoimmune' and the PLT range, and then use the same API with diagnosis as 'All' or a wildcard. However, without knowing the exact diagnosis codes, this is speculative. \n\nGiven the available APIs, the best approach is to use get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis with diagnosis as 'Autoimmune' and PLT thresholds, and then find the total thrombocytopenia patients using another call. But since the user might not have provided specific diagnosis codes, this might not be accurate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is derived from the get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc API with diagnosis as 'Autoimmune' and WBC range, but that's not related to thrombocytopenia. \n\nI think I need to proceed with the assumption that the diagnosis is 'Autoimmune' and use the get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis API with that diagnosis and PLT thresholds. Then, find the total thrombocytopenia patients by using the same API with diagnosis as 'All' or a wildcard. However, since the API might not support wildcards, this might not be possible. \n\nIn conclusion, the steps would be:\n\n1. Call get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis with diagnosis 'Autoimmune' and PLT range (e.g., 0-150) to get the numerator.\n2. Call get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis with diagnosis as 'All' (if possible) and same PLT range to get the denominator.\n3. Calculate the proportion as numerator/denominator.\n\nBut without knowing the exact diagnosis codes, this is uncertain. However, given the available APIs, this seems like the best approach.",

But thrombocytopenia is about platelets, not WBC. So that's not helpful. \n\nAnother thought: the get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_v1_bird_thrombosis_prediction_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_get API requires plt_min and plt_max, and diagnosis. So, if I set plt_min to 0 and plt_max to 150 (assuming units are 10^3/\u00b5L), and diagnosis as 'Autoimmune', that would give the count of patients with autoimmune disease and thrombocytopenia. Then, the total thrombocytopenia patients would be the same API with diagnosis as empty or all. But the API might not support that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total thrombocytopenia patients can be found by calling the same API with diagnosis as a wildcard, but the parameters require specific values. \n\nThis is getting too stuck. Maybe the answer is that the proportion is calculated by dividing the number of patients with autoimmune disease and thrombocytopenia by the total number of patients with thrombocytopenia. To get these numbers, use the get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis API with diagnosis as 'Autoimmune' and the PLT range, and then use the same API with diagnosis as 'All' or a wildcard. However, without knowing the exact diagnosis codes, this is speculative. \n\nGiven the available APIs, the best approach is to use get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis with diagnosis as 'Autoimmune' and PLT thresholds, and then find the total thrombocytopenia patients using another call.

However, since the API might not support wildcards, this might not be possible. \n\nIn conclusion, the steps would be:\n\n1.

Call get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis with diagnosis as 'All' (if possible) and same PLT range to get the denominator.\n3.

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking about the proportion of patients with thrombocytopenia who were diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. First, I need to understand the key terms here. Thrombocytopenia refers to a low platelet count, which can be a sign of various conditions. The disease in question is one where the immune system attacks the body's own cells and tissues, which sounds like an autoimmune disease, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nThe user wants the proportion, so I need to find two numbers: the total number of patients with thrombocytopenia and the number of those patients diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. Then, divide the latter by the former to get the proportion.\n\nLooking at the available APIs, there's get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc_v1... but that's for WBC ranges. Wait, maybe get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc isn't the right one. Let me check again. There's get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc_v1_bird_thrombosis_prediction_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc_get which requires diagnosis, wbc min, and max. Not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, there's get_patient_diagnosis_lab_date_v1... which gives diagnosis and lab date by patient ID. But without a patient ID, that might not help directly. Maybe I need to find patients with thrombocytopenia first. Thrombocytopenia is related to platelet counts, so perhaps looking for patients with low platelet counts (PLT). There's get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_v1... which counts patients with PLT ranges and non-null diagnosis. That might be useful. \n\nWait, the user is asking about the disease that causes the immune system to attack the body's own cells and tissues. That's an autoimmune disease. So, the diagnosis would be something like 'Autoimmune Disease' or specific conditions like 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)', etc. But the exact diagnosis might vary. However, the API functions might not have a specific parameter for autoimmune diseases. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the diagnosis is specified as 'Autoimmune' or similar. Let me check the APIs again. There's get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc, but that's for WBC. Maybe the diagnosis parameter can be set to 'Autoimmune' if that's an option. However, without knowing the exact diagnosis codes, this could be tricky. \n\nAnother approach: the user might be referring to a specific diagnosis like 'SLE' or 'RA'. Let's assume that the diagnosis is 'SLE' for this example. Then, I can use the get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc API to find patients with that diagnosis and a PLT range indicating thrombocytopenia. But I need to determine the PLT thresholds for thrombocytopenia. Typically, thrombocytopenia is defined as platelets < 150,000/\u00b5L. So, setting the PLT min to 0 and max to 150,000. \n\nWait, but the API get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_v1_bird_thrombosis_prediction_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_get requires plt_min and plt_max. So, if I set plt_min to 0 and plt_max to 150, that would capture patients with thrombocytopenia. Then, the diagnosis parameter would be 'Autoimmune' or the specific disease. However, without knowing the exact diagnosis codes, this is uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the diagnosis is 'Autoimmune' and the PLT range is used to filter. But the API might not have a direct way to link PLT with diagnosis. Another thought: perhaps the get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc API can be used with the diagnosis as 'Autoimmune' and WBC range, but that's not directly related to thrombocytopenia. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to first find all patients with thrombocytopenia (using PLT thresholds) and then check their diagnoses. But the APIs available don't directly allow for that. Wait, there's get_patient_diagnosis_lab_date_v1... which gives diagnosis and lab date by patient ID. But without patient IDs, that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_v1... API can be used with a specific diagnosis. For example, if the diagnosis is 'Autoimmune', then the count would be the number of patients with that diagnosis and PLT in the thrombocytopenia range. Then, the total number of patients with thrombocytopenia would be the count from get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis with diagnosis as 'All' or something similar. But the API might not have a 'All' option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis API can be called with diagnosis as an empty string or a wildcard, but the parameters require specific values. This is a bit of a dead end. \n\nWait, perhaps the user is referring to a specific diagnosis like 'SLE' or 'RA', which are autoimmune diseases. Let's assume the diagnosis is 'SLE'. Then, the steps would be:\n\n1. Find the number of patients with SLE and thrombocytopenia (PLT < 150,000).\n2. Find the total number of patients with thrombocytopenia (regardless of diagnosis).\n3. Divide the first number by the second to get the proportion.\n\nBut how to get these numbers using the available APIs. For step 1, use get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis with diagnosis 'SLE' and PLT range. For step 2, use get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis with diagnosis as a wildcard or all. However, the API might not support wildcards. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc API can be used with diagnosis as 'SLE' and WBC range, but that's not directly related. \n\nThis seems challenging.

The API `get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_v1_bird_thrombosis_prediction_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_get` can be used here. I'll set the diagnosis to \"All\" and the PLT range to 0-150 (assuming thrombocytopenia is defined as platelets < 150,000/\u00b5L). \n\nNext, I need to find how many of those patients have an autoimmune disease. I'll use the same API again, but this time set the diagnosis to \"Autoimmune\" and keep the PLT range the same. \n\nSince I can only call one tool at a time, I'll first get the total number of thrombocytopenia patients. Then, I'll make the second call to get the count for autoimmune patients. \n\nWait, but the user might not have a diagnosis code for \"Autoimmune.\" Maybe the correct diagnosis is a specific condition like \"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)\" or \"Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).\" However, without knowing the exact diagnosis codes, I'll proceed with \"Autoimmune\" as a placeholder. \n\nSo, first step: call the API with diagnosis \"All\" to get the total thrombocytopenia patients. Then, call it again with diagnosis \"Autoimmune\" to get the numerator. Finally, calculate the proportion.</think>{\"name\": \"get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_v1_bird_thrombosis_prediction_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_get\", \"arguments\": {\"plt_min\": 0, \"plt_max\": 150, \"diagnosis\": \"All\"}}"

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking about the proportion of patients with thrombocytopenia who were diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. First, I need to understand the key terms here. Thrombocytopenia refers to a low platelet count, which can be a sign of various conditions. The disease in question is one where the immune system attacks the body's own cells and tissues, which sounds like an autoimmune disease, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nThe user wants the proportion, so I need to find two numbers: the total number of patients with thrombocytopenia and the number of those patients diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. Then, divide the latter by the former to get the proportion.\n\nLooking at the available APIs, there's get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc_v1... but that's for WBC ranges. Wait, maybe get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc isn't the right one. Let me check again. There's get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc_v1_bird_thrombosis_prediction_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc_get which requires diagnosis, wbc min, and max. Not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, there's get_patient_diagnosis_lab_date_v1... which gives diagnosis and lab date by patient ID. But without a patient ID, that might not help directly. Maybe I need to find patients with thrombocytopenia first. Thrombocytopenia is related to platelet counts, so perhaps looking for patients with low platelet counts (PLT). There's get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_v1... which counts patients with PLT ranges and non-null diagnosis. That might be useful. \n\nWait, the user is asking about the disease that causes the immune system to attack the body's own cells and tissues. That's an autoimmune disease. So, the diagnosis would be something like 'Autoimmune Disease' or specific conditions like 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)', etc. But the exact diagnosis might vary. However, the API functions might not have a specific parameter for autoimmune diseases. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the diagnosis is specified as 'Autoimmune' or similar. Let me check the APIs again. There's get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc, but that's for WBC. Maybe the diagnosis parameter can be set to 'Autoimmune' if that's an option. However, without knowing the exact diagnosis codes, this could be tricky. \n\nAnother approach: the user might be referring to a specific diagnosis like 'SLE' or 'RA'. Let's assume that the diagnosis is 'SLE' for this example. Then, I can use the get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc API to find patients with that diagnosis and a PLT range indicating thrombocytopenia. But I need to determine the PLT thresholds for thrombocytopenia. Typically, thrombocytopenia is defined as platelets < 150,000/\u00b5L. So, setting the PLT min to 0 and max to 150,000. \n\nWait, but the API get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_v1_bird_thrombosis_prediction_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_get requires plt_min and plt_max. So, if I set plt_min to 0 and plt_max to 150, that would capture patients with thrombocytopenia. Then, the diagnosis parameter would be 'Autoimmune' or the specific disease. However, without knowing the exact diagnosis codes, this is uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the diagnosis is 'Autoimmune' and the PLT range is used to filter. But the API might not have a direct way to link PLT with diagnosis. Another thought: perhaps the get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc API can be used with the diagnosis as 'Autoimmune' and WBC range, but that's not directly related to thrombocytopenia. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to first find all patients with thrombocytopenia (using PLT thresholds) and then check their diagnoses. But the APIs available don't directly allow for that. Wait, there's get_patient_diagnosis_lab_date_v1... which gives diagnosis and lab date by patient ID. But without patient IDs, that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_v1... API can be used with a specific diagnosis. For example, if the diagnosis is 'Autoimmune', then the count would be the number of patients with that diagnosis and PLT in the thrombocytopenia range. Then, the total number of patients with thrombocytopenia would be the count from get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis with diagnosis as 'All' or something similar. But the API might not have a 'All' option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis API can be called with diagnosis as an empty string or a wildcard, but the parameters require specific values. This is a bit of a dead end. \n\nWait, perhaps the user is referring to a specific diagnosis like 'SLE' or 'RA', which are autoimmune diseases. Let's assume the diagnosis is 'SLE'. Then, the steps would be:\n\n1. Find the number of patients with SLE and thrombocytopenia (PLT < 150,000).\n2. Find the total number of patients with thrombocytopenia (regardless of diagnosis).\n3. Divide the first number by the second to get the proportion.\n\nBut how to get these numbers using the available APIs. For step 1, use get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis with diagnosis 'SLE' and PLT range. For step 2, use get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis with diagnosis as a wildcard or all. However, the API might not support wildcards. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc API can be used with diagnosis as 'SLE' and WBC range, but that's not directly related. \n\nThis seems challenging. Maybe the correct approach is to use the get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis API with diagnosis as 'Autoimmune' (if that's a valid diagnosis code) and PLT thresholds. But without knowing the exact diagnosis codes, this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is derived from the get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc API with diagnosis as 'Autoimmune' and WBC range, but again, not directly related to thrombocytopenia. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to use the get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis API with a specific diagnosis (like 'SLE') and PLT thresholds, and then find the total thrombocytopenia patients using another API. However, without knowing the exact diagnosis codes, this might not be accurate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is found using the get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc API with diagnosis as 'Autoimmune' and WBC range, but this is not directly related to thrombocytopenia. \n\nThis is quite complex. Maybe the user is referring to a specific API that can provide the required data. Let me check the list again. \n\nWait, there's get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc_v1_bird_thrombosis_prediction_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc_get which requires diagnosis, wbc_min, and wbc_max. But thrombocytopenia is about platelets, not WBC. So that's not helpful. \n\nAnother thought: the get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_v1_bird_thrombosis_prediction_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_get API requires plt_min and plt_max, and diagnosis. So, if I set plt_min to 0 and plt_max to 150 (assuming units are 10^3/\u00b5L), and diagnosis as 'Autoimmune', that would give the count of patients with autoimmune disease and thrombocytopenia. Then, the total thrombocytopenia patients would be the same API with diagnosis as empty or all. But the API might not support that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total thrombocytopenia patients can be found by calling the same API with diagnosis as a wildcard, but the parameters require specific values. \n\nThis is getting too stuck. Maybe the answer is that the proportion is calculated by dividing the number of patients with autoimmune disease and thrombocytopenia by the total number of patients with thrombocytopenia. To get these numbers, use the get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis API with diagnosis as 'Autoimmune' and the PLT range, and then use the same API with diagnosis as 'All' or a wildcard. However, without knowing the exact diagnosis codes, this is speculative. \n\nGiven the available APIs, the best approach is to use get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis with diagnosis as 'Autoimmune' and PLT thresholds, and then find the total thrombocytopenia patients using another call. But since the user might not have provided specific diagnosis codes, this might not be accurate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is derived from the get_patient_count_by_diagnosis_wbc API with diagnosis as 'Autoimmune' and WBC range, but that's not related to thrombocytopenia. \n\nI think I need to proceed with the assumption that the diagnosis is 'Autoimmune' and use the get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis API with that diagnosis and PLT thresholds. Then, find the total thrombocytopenia patients by using the same API with diagnosis as 'All' or a wildcard. However, since the API might not support wildcards, this might not be possible. \n\nIn conclusion, the steps would be:\n\n1. Call get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis with diagnosis 'Autoimmune' and PLT range (e.g., 0-150) to get the numerator.\n2. Call get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis with diagnosis as 'All' (if possible) and same PLT range to get the denominator.\n3. Calculate the proportion as numerator/denominator.\n\nBut without knowing the exact diagnosis codes, this is uncertain. However, given the available APIs, this seems like the best approach.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_v1_bird_thrombosis_prediction_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_get\", \"arguments\": {\"plt_min\": 0, \"plt_max\": 150, \"diagnosis\": \"Autoimmune\"}}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"get_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_v1_bird_thrombosis_prediction_patient_count_by_plt_diagnosis_get\", \"arguments\": {\"plt_min\": 0, \"plt_max\": 150, \"diagnosis\": \"All\"}}\n</tool_call>"
