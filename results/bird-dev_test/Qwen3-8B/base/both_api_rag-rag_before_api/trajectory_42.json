So, perhaps I need to focus on the t-shirt size and the $50 amount.\n\nWait, the question is about the percentage of the amount $50 received by the club among members with medium t-shirt size.

Let me check the APIs related to income or expenses. \n\nThe get_income_by_member_v1_bird_student_club_income_by_member_get could help find income amounts for members.

Then, perhaps find how many of those members have an income of $50. But the income APIs require first and last names. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the $50 is a specific expense or income category. The get_total_amount_v1_bird_student_club_total_amount_get could get the total amount for an event, but the user hasn't specified an event. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me try to structure the steps:\n\n1. Find the number of members with medium t-shirt size using get_member_count_by_tshirt_size_get. But wait, there's no API for that. Wait, looking back, the available APIs include get_members_by_tshirt_size_v1_bird_student_club_members_by_tshirt_size_get, which returns members with a specific t-shirt size. So, using that API with t_shirt_size: \"medium\" would give the list of members. Then, from that list, check how many have an income of $50. \n\nBut how to get the income? The get_income_by_member_v1_bird_student_club_income_by_member_get requires first and last names. So, if I can get the list of members with medium t-shirt size, then for each member, check their income. But that would require multiple API calls. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the $50 is a specific income amount, and the user wants the percentage of members with medium t-shirt size who received that amount. \n\nBut without knowing which members received $50, this is challenging.

For example, if the club received $50 total, what percentage of that is from members with medium t-shirt size. But again, without knowing the breakdown, this is unclear. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to first get the count of members with medium t-shirt size.
