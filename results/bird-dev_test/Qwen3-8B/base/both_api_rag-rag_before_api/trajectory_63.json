        "thought": "Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking for the constructor reference name of the champion in the 2009 Formula One race at Marina Bay Street Circuit and its website.\n\nFirst, I need to find out which constructor won that specific race. The Marina Bay Street Circuit is in Singapore, so I should check the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix. The champion for that race would be the winner of that particular event. \n\nTo get the constructor's reference name, I might need the race ID or details about the race. Since the user mentioned the circuit name and year, I can use the get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get function with the year 2009 to find the race names. But since the circuit is specified, maybe there's a way to get the race ID first. Alternatively, I can use the get_race_names_by_country_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_country_get function with the country Singapore to find the race name. Wait, but the user specified the circuit name, not the country. Hmm.\n\nWait, the get_circuit_url_v1_bird_formula_1_circuit_url_get function can get the URL for a circuit name. But the user wants the constructor's reference and website. Maybe I need to find the race details first. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the get_race_details_v1_bird_formula_1_race_details_get function requires a driver's name, which I don't have. Maybe I should first find the race ID for the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix. To get the race ID, I can use the get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009. Once I have the race name, I can then get the race details, which might include the winner's constructor.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for the constructor reference name and website. The constructor reference might be found via the get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function, but that requires a constructor name. Alternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function might need race details. \n\nAlternatively, the get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get function can get the winner of a specific race by name and year. Once I have the winner's name, I can find their constructor. Then, using the constructor's name, I can get the reference and website. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Find the race name for the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix using the circuit name. Wait, but the get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get function takes a year. Let me check if there's a function that can get race names by circuit and year. The get_race_names_by_country_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_country_get function takes a country, but the user specified the circuit. Maybe the get_race_date_v1_bird_formula_1_race_date_get function can get the date for a specific circuit and race name. But I need the race name first. \n\nAlternatively, the get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009 will give all races in that year. Then, I can check which one is the Singapore Grand Prix. Once I have the race name, I can use get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get with the race name and year 2009 to get the winner. Then, find the constructor for that winner. \n\nOnce I have the constructor's name, I can use get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get to get the position, but that might not give the reference. Alternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function might provide the website. \n\nWait, the user wants the constructor's reference name and website. The constructor reference might be the constructor's code, like Ferrari, Red Bull, etc. The website would be the official site. \n\nSo, step-by-step:\n\n1. Use get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009 to get the list of races in 2009. Identify the Singapore Grand Prix from the list.\n\n2. Once the race name is known, use get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get with race_name \"Singapore Grand Prix\" and year 2009 to get the winner's driver name.\n\n3. Then, find the constructor for that driver. The get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function might not be the right one. Alternatively, the get_driver_details_by_position_v1_bird_formula_1_driver_details_by_position_get function could be used if I have the driver's name and the race details. Wait, but I need the constructor's name. \n\nAlternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function requires race name and year. So once I have the race name and year, I can get the constructor details. \n\nWait, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function's parameters are race_name and year. So if I have the race name and year, I can get the constructor details, which might include the constructor's reference and website. \n\nSo, after getting the race name (Singapore Grand Prix) and year (2009), call get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get with those parameters. That should return the constructor's details, including the reference name and website. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function can get the constructor's name based on the race and position. But I'm not sure. \n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\n- Find the race name for 2009 Singapore GP.\n- Get the winner of that race.\n- Get the constructor's details for that race, which would include the constructor's reference and website.\n\nSo first, call get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009. The response should include the race names. Then, identify the Singapore Grand Prix. \n\nOnce I have the race name, use get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get with race_name and year 2009 to get the winner's name. Then, perhaps use get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get with the race name and year to get the constructor's details. \n\nAlternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function might return the constructor's name, reference, and website. \n\nSo, the first step is to get the race names for 2009.

Then, I can check which one is the Singapore Grand Prix. Once I have the race name, I can use get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get with the race name and year 2009 to get the winner. Then, find the constructor for that winner. \n\nOnce I have the constructor's name, I can use get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get to get the position, but that might not give the reference. Alternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function might provide the website. \n\nWait, the user wants the constructor's reference name and website. The constructor reference might be the constructor's code, like Ferrari, Red Bull, etc. The website would be the official site. \n\nSo, step-by-step:\n\n1. Use get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009 to get the list of races in 2009. Identify the Singapore Grand Prix from the list.\n\n2. Once the race name is known, use get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get with race_name \"Singapore Grand Prix\" and year 2009 to get the winner's driver name.\n\n3. Then, find the constructor for that driver. The get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function might not be the right one. Alternatively, the get_driver_details_by_position_v1_bird_formula_1_driver_details_by_position_get function could be used if I have the driver's name and the race details. Wait, but I need the constructor's name. \n\nAlternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function requires race name and year. So once I have the race name and year, I can get the constructor details. \n\nWait, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function's parameters are race_name and year. So if I have the race name and year, I can get the constructor details, which might include the constructor's reference and website. \n\nSo, after getting the race name (Singapore Grand Prix) and year (2009), call get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get with those parameters. That should return the constructor's details, including the reference name and website. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function can get the constructor's name based on the race and position. But I'm not sure. \n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\n- Find the race name for 2009 Singapore GP.\n- Get the winner of that race.\n- Get the constructor's details for that race, which would include the constructor's reference and website.\n\nSo first, call get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009. The response should include the race names. Then, identify the Singapore Grand Prix. \n\nOnce I have the race name, use get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get with race_name and year 2009 to get the winner's name. Then, perhaps use get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get with the race name and year to get the constructor's details. \n\nAlternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function might return the constructor's name, reference, and website. \n\nSo, the first step is to get the race names for 2009.

Find the race name for the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix using the circuit name. Wait, but the get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get function takes a year. Let me check if there's a function that can get race names by circuit and year. The get_race_names_by_country_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_country_get function takes a country, but the user specified the circuit. Maybe the get_race_date_v1_bird_formula_1_race_date_get function can get the date for a specific circuit and race name. But I need the race name first. \n\nAlternatively, the get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009 will give all races in that year. Then, I can check which one is the Singapore Grand Prix. Once I have the race name, I can use get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get with the race name and year 2009 to get the winner. Then, find the constructor for that winner. \n\nOnce I have the constructor's name, I can use get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get to get the position, but that might not give the reference. Alternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function might provide the website. \n\nWait, the user wants the constructor's reference name and website. The constructor reference might be the constructor's code, like Ferrari, Red Bull, etc. The website would be the official site. \n\nSo, step-by-step:\n\n1. Use get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009 to get the list of races in 2009. Identify the Singapore Grand Prix from the list.\n\n2. Once the race name is known, use get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get with race_name \"Singapore Grand Prix\" and year 2009 to get the winner's driver name.\n\n3. Then, find the constructor for that driver. The get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function might not be the right one. Alternatively, the get_driver_details_by_position_v1_bird_formula_1_driver_details_by_position_get function could be used if I have the driver's name and the race details. Wait, but I need the constructor's name. \n\nAlternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function requires race name and year. So once I have the race name and year, I can get the constructor details. \n\nWait, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function's parameters are race_name and year. So if I have the race name and year, I can get the constructor details, which might include the constructor's reference and website. \n\nSo, after getting the race name (Singapore Grand Prix) and year (2009), call get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get with those parameters. That should return the constructor's details, including the reference name and website. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function can get the constructor's name based on the race and position. But I'm not sure. \n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\n- Find the race name for 2009 Singapore GP.\n- Get the winner of that race.\n- Get the constructor's details for that race, which would include the constructor's reference and website.\n\nSo first, call get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009. The response should include the race names. Then, identify the Singapore Grand Prix. \n\nOnce I have the race name, use get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get with race_name and year 2009 to get the winner's name. Then, perhaps use get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get with the race name and year to get the constructor's details. \n\nAlternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function might return the constructor's name, reference, and website. \n\nSo, the first step is to get the race names for 2009. Let's start with that.</think>{\"name\": \"get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get\", \"arguments\": {\"year\": 2009}}"

The Marina Bay Street Circuit is in Singapore, so I should check the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix. The champion for that race would be the winner of that particular event. \n\nTo get the constructor's reference name, I might need the race ID or details about the race. Since the user mentioned the circuit name and year, I can use the get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get function with the year 2009 to find the race names. But since the circuit is specified, maybe there's a way to get the race ID first. Alternatively, I can use the get_race_names_by_country_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_country_get function with the country Singapore to find the race name. Wait, but the user specified the circuit name, not the country. Hmm.\n\nWait, the get_circuit_url_v1_bird_formula_1_circuit_url_get function can get the URL for a circuit name. But the user wants the constructor's reference and website. Maybe I need to find the race details first.

Once I have the race name, I can then get the race details, which might include the winner's constructor.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for the constructor reference name and website. The constructor reference might be found via the get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function, but that requires a constructor name.

Find the race name for the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix using the circuit name. Wait, but the get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get function takes a year. Let me check if there's a function that can get race names by circuit and year. The get_race_names_by_country_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_country_get function takes a country, but the user specified the circuit. Maybe the get_race_date_v1_bird_formula_1_race_date_get function can get the date for a specific circuit and race name. But I need the race name first. \n\nAlternatively, the get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009 will give all races in that year. Then, I can check which one is the Singapore Grand Prix. Once I have the race name, I can use get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get with the race name and year 2009 to get the winner. Then, find the constructor for that winner. \n\nOnce I have the constructor's name, I can use get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get to get the position, but that might not give the reference. Alternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function might provide the website. \n\nWait, the user wants the constructor's reference name and website. The constructor reference might be the constructor's code, like Ferrari, Red Bull, etc. The website would be the official site. \n\nSo, step-by-step:\n\n1. Use get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009 to get the list of races in 2009. Identify the Singapore Grand Prix from the list.\n\n2. Once the race name is known, use get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get with race_name \"Singapore Grand Prix\" and year 2009 to get the winner's driver name.\n\n3. Then, find the constructor for that driver. The get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function might not be the right one. Alternatively, the get_driver_details_by_position_v1_bird_formula_1_driver_details_by_position_get function could be used if I have the driver's name and the race details. Wait, but I need the constructor's name. \n\nAlternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function requires race name and year.

          "content": "<think>Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking for the constructor reference name of the champion in the 2009 Formula One race at Marina Bay Street Circuit and its website.\n\nFirst, I need to find out which constructor won that specific race. The Marina Bay Street Circuit is in Singapore, so I should check the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix. The champion for that race would be the winner of that particular event. \n\nTo get the constructor's reference name, I might need the race ID or details about the race. Since the user mentioned the circuit name and year, I can use the get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get function with the year 2009 to find the race names. But since the circuit is specified, maybe there's a way to get the race ID first. Alternatively, I can use the get_race_names_by_country_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_country_get function with the country Singapore to find the race name. Wait, but the user specified the circuit name, not the country. Hmm.\n\nWait, the get_circuit_url_v1_bird_formula_1_circuit_url_get function can get the URL for a circuit name. But the user wants the constructor's reference and website. Maybe I need to find the race details first. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the get_race_details_v1_bird_formula_1_race_details_get function requires a driver's name, which I don't have. Maybe I should first find the race ID for the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix. To get the race ID, I can use the get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009. Once I have the race name, I can then get the race details, which might include the winner's constructor.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for the constructor reference name and website. The constructor reference might be found via the get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function, but that requires a constructor name. Alternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function might need race details. \n\nAlternatively, the get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get function can get the winner of a specific race by name and year. Once I have the winner's name, I can find their constructor. Then, using the constructor's name, I can get the reference and website. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Find the race name for the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix using the circuit name. Wait, but the get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get function takes a year. Let me check if there's a function that can get race names by circuit and year. The get_race_names_by_country_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_country_get function takes a country, but the user specified the circuit. Maybe the get_race_date_v1_bird_formula_1_race_date_get function can get the date for a specific circuit and race name. But I need the race name first. \n\nAlternatively, the get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009 will give all races in that year. Then, I can check which one is the Singapore Grand Prix. Once I have the race name, I can use get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get with the race name and year 2009 to get the winner. Then, find the constructor for that winner. \n\nOnce I have the constructor's name, I can use get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get to get the position, but that might not give the reference. Alternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function might provide the website. \n\nWait, the user wants the constructor's reference name and website. The constructor reference might be the constructor's code, like Ferrari, Red Bull, etc. The website would be the official site. \n\nSo, step-by-step:\n\n1. Use get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009 to get the list of races in 2009. Identify the Singapore Grand Prix from the list.\n\n2. Once the race name is known, use get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get with race_name \"Singapore Grand Prix\" and year 2009 to get the winner's driver name.\n\n3. Then, find the constructor for that driver. The get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function might not be the right one. Alternatively, the get_driver_details_by_position_v1_bird_formula_1_driver_details_by_position_get function could be used if I have the driver's name and the race details. Wait, but I need the constructor's name. \n\nAlternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function requires race name and year. So once I have the race name and year, I can get the constructor details. \n\nWait, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function's parameters are race_name and year. So if I have the race name and year, I can get the constructor details, which might include the constructor's reference and website. \n\nSo, after getting the race name (Singapore Grand Prix) and year (2009), call get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get with those parameters. That should return the constructor's details, including the reference name and website. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function can get the constructor's name based on the race and position. But I'm not sure. \n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\n- Find the race name for 2009 Singapore GP.\n- Get the winner of that race.\n- Get the constructor's details for that race, which would include the constructor's reference and website.\n\nSo first, call get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009. The response should include the race names. Then, identify the Singapore Grand Prix. \n\nOnce I have the race name, use get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get with race_name and year 2009 to get the winner's name. Then, perhaps use get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get with the race name and year to get the constructor's details. \n\nAlternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function might return the constructor's name, reference, and website. \n\nSo, the first step is to get the race names for 2009. Let's start with that.</think>{\"name\": \"get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get\", \"arguments\": {\"year\": 2009}}"

Now, I need to find out the winner of that specific race.\n\nNext, I should call the get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get function with the race_name \"Singapore Grand Prix\" and year 2009. This should give me the name of the champion driver for that race. Once I have the driver's name, I can then determine the constructor they were with, as the constructor's reference name and website are required.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to get the constructor's details directly. The get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function requires the race name and year. If I use that function with the Singapore Grand Prix and 2009, it might return the constructor's information, including their reference name and website.

Alternatively, once I have the driver's name, I can use the get_driver_details_by_position_v1_bird_formula_1_driver_details_by_position_get function to find the constructor.

Since the winner is in position 1, maybe that's a way to get the constructor.\n\nBut perhaps the most straightforward way is to first get the race winner, then find their constructor. Let me proceed step by step. First, get the winner of the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix.</think>{\"name\": \"get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get\", \"arguments\": {\"race_name\": \"Singapore Grand Prix\", \"year\": 2009}}"

Alternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function might take the race name and year to provide the constructor's details. Let me check the available functions again.\n\nWait, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function's parameters are race_name and year. So if I use that with the Singapore Grand Prix and 2009, it should return the constructor's details. Let me try that. \n\nAlternatively, since I know the driver's name, I can use the get_driver_details_by_position_v1_bird_formula_1_driver_details_by_position_get function with the year 2009, race name \"Singapore Grand Prix\", and position 1 to get the constructor. \n\nBut I'm not sure if that function provides the constructor's reference name. Let me think. The get_driver_details_by_position_v1_bird_formula_1_driver_details_by_position_get function's description says it gets driver details for a given year, race name, and position. The parameters are year, race_name, and position. The response might include the constructor's name. \n\nAlternatively, the get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function takes a constructor name and returns the position, but I don't have the constructor's name yet. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best approach is to use the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function with the race name and year. Let me try that. \n\nWait, but the user is asking for the constructor's reference name and website. The get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get might not be the right function. Let me check the available functions again. \n\nLooking back, there's a get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function, which gets the position for a given constructor name. But I need the constructor's name. \n\nAlternatively, the get_constructor_nationality_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_nationality_get function requires race_id and points, which I don't have. \n\nWait, maybe I can use the get_driver_details_by_position_v1_bird_formula_1_driver_details_by_position_get function with the year 2009, race name \"Singapore Grand Prix\", and position 1. This should give me the driver's details, including the constructor. \n\nLet me try that. The parameters are year, race_name, and position. So the function call would be:\n\nget_driver_details_by_position_v1_bird_formula_1_driver_details_by_position_get with year=2009, race_name=\"Singapore Grand Prix\", position=1. \n\nThis should return the driver's details, which might include the constructor's name. Once I have the constructor's name, I can then find the reference name and website. \n\nAlternatively, the get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function might not be helpful here. \n\nSo, proceeding with the get_driver_details_by_position_v1_bird_formula_1_driver_details_by_position_get function.

Once I have the driver's name, I can then determine the constructor they were with, as the constructor's reference name and website are required.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to get the constructor's details directly. The get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function requires the race name and year. If I use that function with the Singapore Grand Prix and 2009, it might return the constructor's information, including their reference name and website. However, I'm not entirely sure if that function provides the constructor's reference name. Alternatively, once I have the driver's name, I can use the get_driver_details_by_position_v1_bird_formula_1_driver_details_by_position_get function to find the constructor. But that function requires the year, race name, and position. Since the winner is in position 1, maybe that's a way to get the constructor.\n\nBut perhaps the most straightforward way is to first get the race winner, then find their constructor. Let me proceed step by step. First, get the winner of the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix.</think>{\"name\": \"get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get\", \"arguments\": {\"race_name\": \"Singapore Grand Prix\", \"year\": 2009}}"

Alternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function might take the race name and year to provide the constructor's details.

Let me think. The get_driver_details_by_position_v1_bird_formula_1_driver_details_by_position_get function's description says it gets driver details for a given year, race name, and position. The parameters are year, race_name, and position. The response might include the constructor's name. \n\nAlternatively, the get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function takes a constructor name and returns the position, but I don't have the constructor's name yet. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best approach is to use the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function with the race name and year. Let me try that. \n\nWait, but the user is asking for the constructor's reference name and website. The get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get might not be the right function. Let me check the available functions again. \n\nLooking back, there's a get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function, which gets the position for a given constructor name.

Once I have the constructor's name, I can then find the reference name and website. \n\nAlternatively, the get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function might not be helpful here. \n\nSo, proceeding with the get_driver_details_by_position_v1_bird_formula_1_driver_details_by_position_get function.

          "content": "<think>Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking for the constructor reference name of the champion in the 2009 Formula One race at Marina Bay Street Circuit and its website.\n\nFirst, I need to find out which constructor won that specific race. The Marina Bay Street Circuit is in Singapore, so I should check the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix. The champion for that race would be the winner of that particular event. \n\nTo get the constructor's reference name, I might need the race ID or details about the race. Since the user mentioned the circuit name and year, I can use the get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get function with the year 2009 to find the race names. But since the circuit is specified, maybe there's a way to get the race ID first. Alternatively, I can use the get_race_names_by_country_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_country_get function with the country Singapore to find the race name. Wait, but the user specified the circuit name, not the country. Hmm.\n\nWait, the get_circuit_url_v1_bird_formula_1_circuit_url_get function can get the URL for a circuit name. But the user wants the constructor's reference and website. Maybe I need to find the race details first. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the get_race_details_v1_bird_formula_1_race_details_get function requires a driver's name, which I don't have. Maybe I should first find the race ID for the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix. To get the race ID, I can use the get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009. Once I have the race name, I can then get the race details, which might include the winner's constructor.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for the constructor reference name and website. The constructor reference might be found via the get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function, but that requires a constructor name. Alternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function might need race details. \n\nAlternatively, the get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get function can get the winner of a specific race by name and year. Once I have the winner's name, I can find their constructor. Then, using the constructor's name, I can get the reference and website. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Find the race name for the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix using the circuit name. Wait, but the get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get function takes a year. Let me check if there's a function that can get race names by circuit and year. The get_race_names_by_country_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_country_get function takes a country, but the user specified the circuit. Maybe the get_race_date_v1_bird_formula_1_race_date_get function can get the date for a specific circuit and race name. But I need the race name first. \n\nAlternatively, the get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009 will give all races in that year. Then, I can check which one is the Singapore Grand Prix. Once I have the race name, I can use get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get with the race name and year 2009 to get the winner. Then, find the constructor for that winner. \n\nOnce I have the constructor's name, I can use get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get to get the position, but that might not give the reference. Alternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function might provide the website. \n\nWait, the user wants the constructor's reference name and website. The constructor reference might be the constructor's code, like Ferrari, Red Bull, etc. The website would be the official site. \n\nSo, step-by-step:\n\n1. Use get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009 to get the list of races in 2009. Identify the Singapore Grand Prix from the list.\n\n2. Once the race name is known, use get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get with race_name \"Singapore Grand Prix\" and year 2009 to get the winner's driver name.\n\n3. Then, find the constructor for that driver. The get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function might not be the right one. Alternatively, the get_driver_details_by_position_v1_bird_formula_1_driver_details_by_position_get function could be used if I have the driver's name and the race details. Wait, but I need the constructor's name. \n\nAlternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function requires race name and year. So once I have the race name and year, I can get the constructor details. \n\nWait, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function's parameters are race_name and year. So if I have the race name and year, I can get the constructor details, which might include the constructor's reference and website. \n\nSo, after getting the race name (Singapore Grand Prix) and year (2009), call get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get with those parameters. That should return the constructor's details, including the reference name and website. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function can get the constructor's name based on the race and position. But I'm not sure. \n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\n- Find the race name for 2009 Singapore GP.\n- Get the winner of that race.\n- Get the constructor's details for that race, which would include the constructor's reference and website.\n\nSo first, call get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009. The response should include the race names. Then, identify the Singapore Grand Prix. \n\nOnce I have the race name, use get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get with race_name and year 2009 to get the winner's name. Then, perhaps use get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get with the race name and year to get the constructor's details. \n\nAlternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function might return the constructor's name, reference, and website. \n\nSo, the first step is to get the race names for 2009.

          "content": "<think>Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking for the constructor reference name of the champion in the 2009 Formula One race at Marina Bay Street Circuit and its website.\n\nFirst, I need to find out which constructor won that specific race. The Marina Bay Street Circuit is in Singapore, so I should check the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix. The champion for that race would be the winner of that particular event. \n\nTo get the constructor's reference name, I might need the race ID or details about the race. Since the user mentioned the circuit name and year, I can use the get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get function with the year 2009 to find the race names. But since the circuit is specified, maybe there's a way to get the race ID first. Alternatively, I can use the get_race_names_by_country_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_country_get function with the country Singapore to find the race name. Wait, but the user specified the circuit name, not the country. Hmm.\n\nWait, the get_circuit_url_v1_bird_formula_1_circuit_url_get function can get the URL for a circuit name. But the user wants the constructor's reference and website. Maybe I need to find the race details first. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the get_race_details_v1_bird_formula_1_race_details_get function requires a driver's name, which I don't have. Maybe I should first find the race ID for the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix. To get the race ID, I can use the get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009. Once I have the race name, I can then get the race details, which might include the winner's constructor.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for the constructor reference name and website. The constructor reference might be found via the get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function, but that requires a constructor name. Alternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function might need race details. \n\nAlternatively, the get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get function can get the winner of a specific race by name and year. Once I have the winner's name, I can find their constructor. Then, using the constructor's name, I can get the reference and website. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Find the race name for the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix using the circuit name. Wait, but the get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get function takes a year. Let me check if there's a function that can get race names by circuit and year. The get_race_names_by_country_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_country_get function takes a country, but the user specified the circuit. Maybe the get_race_date_v1_bird_formula_1_race_date_get function can get the date for a specific circuit and race name. But I need the race name first. \n\nAlternatively, the get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009 will give all races in that year. Then, I can check which one is the Singapore Grand Prix. Once I have the race name, I can use get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get with the race name and year 2009 to get the winner. Then, find the constructor for that winner. \n\nOnce I have the constructor's name, I can use get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get to get the position, but that might not give the reference. Alternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function might provide the website. \n\nWait, the user wants the constructor's reference name and website. The constructor reference might be the constructor's code, like Ferrari, Red Bull, etc. The website would be the official site. \n\nSo, step-by-step:\n\n1. Use get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009 to get the list of races in 2009. Identify the Singapore Grand Prix from the list.\n\n2. Once the race name is known, use get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get with race_name \"Singapore Grand Prix\" and year 2009 to get the winner's driver name.\n\n3. Then, find the constructor for that driver. The get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function might not be the right one. Alternatively, the get_driver_details_by_position_v1_bird_formula_1_driver_details_by_position_get function could be used if I have the driver's name and the race details. Wait, but I need the constructor's name. \n\nAlternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function requires race name and year. So once I have the race name and year, I can get the constructor details. \n\nWait, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function's parameters are race_name and year. So if I have the race name and year, I can get the constructor details, which might include the constructor's reference and website. \n\nSo, after getting the race name (Singapore Grand Prix) and year (2009), call get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get with those parameters. That should return the constructor's details, including the reference name and website. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function can get the constructor's name based on the race and position. But I'm not sure. \n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\n- Find the race name for 2009 Singapore GP.\n- Get the winner of that race.\n- Get the constructor's details for that race, which would include the constructor's reference and website.\n\nSo first, call get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get with year 2009. The response should include the race names. Then, identify the Singapore Grand Prix. \n\nOnce I have the race name, use get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get with race_name and year 2009 to get the winner's name. Then, perhaps use get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get with the race name and year to get the constructor's details. \n\nAlternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function might return the constructor's name, reference, and website. \n\nSo, the first step is to get the race names for 2009. Let's start with that.</think>{\"name\": \"get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get\", \"arguments\": {\"year\": 2009}}"

From the previous step, I used the get_race_names_by_year_v1_bird_formula_1_race_names_by_year_get function with the year 2009, and the response included 'Singapore Grand Prix' as one of the race names. Now, I need to find out the winner of that specific race.\n\nNext, I should call the get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get function with the race_name \"Singapore Grand Prix\" and year 2009. This should give me the name of the champion driver for that race. Once I have the driver's name, I can then determine the constructor they were with, as the constructor's reference name and website are required.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to get the constructor's details directly. The get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function requires the race name and year. If I use that function with the Singapore Grand Prix and 2009, it might return the constructor's information, including their reference name and website. However, I'm not entirely sure if that function provides the constructor's reference name. Alternatively, once I have the driver's name, I can use the get_driver_details_by_position_v1_bird_formula_1_driver_details_by_position_get function to find the constructor. But that function requires the year, race name, and position. Since the winner is in position 1, maybe that's a way to get the constructor.\n\nBut perhaps the most straightforward way is to first get the race winner, then find their constructor. Let me proceed step by step. First, get the winner of the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix.</think>{\"name\": \"get_race_winner_v1_bird_formula_1_race_winner_get\", \"arguments\": {\"race_name\": \"Singapore Grand Prix\", \"year\": 2009}}"

          "content": "<think>Okay, so the winner of the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix was Fernando Alonso. Now, I need to find out which constructor he was driving for. The constructor's reference name and website are required. \n\nTo get the constructor's information, I can use the get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function, but that requires the constructor's name. Alternatively, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function might take the race name and year to provide the constructor's details. Let me check the available functions again.\n\nWait, the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function's parameters are race_name and year. So if I use that with the Singapore Grand Prix and 2009, it should return the constructor's details. Let me try that. \n\nAlternatively, since I know the driver's name, I can use the get_driver_details_by_position_v1_bird_formula_1_driver_details_by_position_get function with the year 2009, race name \"Singapore Grand Prix\", and position 1 to get the constructor. \n\nBut I'm not sure if that function provides the constructor's reference name. Let me think. The get_driver_details_by_position_v1_bird_formula_1_driver_details_by_position_get function's description says it gets driver details for a given year, race name, and position. The parameters are year, race_name, and position. The response might include the constructor's name. \n\nAlternatively, the get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function takes a constructor name and returns the position, but I don't have the constructor's name yet. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best approach is to use the get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get function with the race name and year. Let me try that. \n\nWait, but the user is asking for the constructor's reference name and website. The get_constructor_details_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_details_get might not be the right function. Let me check the available functions again. \n\nLooking back, there's a get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function, which gets the position for a given constructor name. But I need the constructor's name. \n\nAlternatively, the get_constructor_nationality_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_nationality_get function requires race_id and points, which I don't have. \n\nWait, maybe I can use the get_driver_details_by_position_v1_bird_formula_1_driver_details_by_position_get function with the year 2009, race name \"Singapore Grand Prix\", and position 1. This should give me the driver's details, including the constructor. \n\nLet me try that. The parameters are year, race_name, and position. So the function call would be:\n\nget_driver_details_by_position_v1_bird_formula_1_driver_details_by_position_get with year=2009, race_name=\"Singapore Grand Prix\", position=1. \n\nThis should return the driver's details, which might include the constructor's name. Once I have the constructor's name, I can then find the reference name and website. \n\nAlternatively, the get_constructor_position_v1_bird_formula_1_constructor_position_get function might not be helpful here. \n\nSo, proceeding with the get_driver_details_by_position_v1_bird_formula_1_driver_details_by_position_get function.
