Ajax, an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page.\n\nThe term Ajax was first introduced in 2005 by Jesse James Garrett, a co-founder of Adaptive Path, in an article titled \"Ajax: A New Approach to Web Applications.\" Before the advent of Ajax, web pages would have to be completely reloaded to update the data on the page, which was time-consuming and inefficient. Ajax changed this by allowing parts of a web page to be updated without needing to refresh the entire page.\n\nAjax has become an essential tool for web developers, enabling them to create more dynamic and responsive web applications. It has been used in the development of many popular web applications, including Google Maps, Gmail, and Facebook. Ajax has also been instrumental in the development of web-based games and other interactive applications."

This condition can be caused by various factors, including infections, autoimmune diseases, and genetic disorders. The aorta is a vital blood vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body. When the aorta becomes inflamed, it can lead to serious complications such as aortic aneurysms, aortic dissection, and even death.\n\nThe symptoms of aortitis can vary depending on the underlying cause and the severity of the inflammation. Some people may experience no symptoms at all, while others may have chest pain, back pain, fever, fatigue, and weight loss. In severe cases, aortitis can cause life-threatening complications such as aortic rupture or dissection.\n\nThe diagnosis of aortitis can be challenging because the symptoms are often nonspecific and can mimic other conditions. Imaging studies such as CT scans, MRI, and PET scans can help diagnose aortitis and assess its severity. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause and the severity of the inflammation. In some cases, medications such as corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and antibiotics may be used to reduce inflammation and prevent complications. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair or replace the damaged aorta."

      "response": "Coldsnap is a unique expansion set in the popular collectible card game, Magic: The Gathering. Released in 2006, Coldsnap is the third and final set in the Ice Age block, which also includes the sets Ice Age and Alliances. The set is known for its unique mechanics and themes, which revolve around the harsh, frozen landscape of the plane of Dominaria.\n\nOne of the most notable features of Coldsnap is its \"snow\" theme. Many cards in the set have the \"snow\" supertype, which allows them to interact with other snow cards in unique ways. For example, some cards gain bonuses when played with other snow cards, while others can only be played if the player has a certain number of snow permanents in play. This theme adds a new layer of strategy to the game, as players must carefully consider which snow cards to include in their decks.\n\nAnother unique feature of Coldsnap is its \"rare\" cycle of cards. Each color in the game has a rare card that is particularly powerful and sought after by players. These cards often have unique abilities or effects that can turn the tide of a game. For example, the rare white card \"Enduring Renewal\" allows players to repeatedly sacrifice creatures and then return them to play, while the rare black card \"Necroskitter\" can steal creatures from an opponent's graveyard. These rare cards are highly prized by collectors and competitive players alike.\n\nOverall, Coldsnap is a beloved expansion set in Magic: The Gathering, known for its unique mechanics, themes, and rare cards. Its snow theme adds a new layer of strategy to the game, while its rare cycle of cards offers powerful options for players to build their decks around. Whether you're a casual player or a competitive one, Coldsnap is a set that is sure to offer something for everyone."

The club has a rich history and is known for its passionate fanbase, who are often referred to as \"Jambos.\"\n\nThe Heart of Midlothian has a unique identity, with its iconic colors of maroon and white. The club has a fierce rivalry with Hibernian, another Edinburgh-based team, and their matches are known as the \"Edinburgh Derby.\" The Heart of Midlothian has had its share of ups and downs, having won the Scottish league championship four times and the Scottish Cup eight times, but also having spent time in the lower divisions.\n\nThe club's home ground is Tynecastle Park, a historic stadium that has been the club's home since 1886. The stadium has undergone several renovations over the years, with the most recent one being completed in 2017. The Heart of Midlothian is more than just a football club; it is a symbol of Edinburgh and a source of pride for its fans."

The Japanese language, in particular, is one of the most complex and intriguing languages in the world. It is an agglutinative language, which means that words are formed by adding affixes to a root word. This makes the language highly contextual and nuanced.\n\nJapanese is also unique in its writing system, which combines three scripts: hiragana, katakana, and kanji. Hiragana and katakana are phonetic alphabets, while kanji are Chinese characters that represent words or ideas. This complex writing system allows for a high degree of expressiveness and artistic creativity.\n\nJapanese culture is also renowned for its cuisine. Sushi, ramen, and tempura are just a few examples of the many delicious dishes that have become popular around the world. Japanese cuisine is known for its emphasis on fresh, seasonal ingredients and its meticulous presentation.\n\nIn addition to its rich cultural heritage, Japan is also a global leader in technology and innovation. Japanese companies like Sony, Toyota, and Nintendo have made significant contributions to the fields of electronics, automobiles, and video games."

Unlike normal functioning immune systems that protect the body against viruses and bacteria, SLE causes the immune system to attack the body's own cells and tissues, leading to inflammation and tissue damage.\n\nSLE is a complex disease that can be difficult to diagnose due to its wide range of symptoms, which can often mimic those of other conditions. These symptoms can include fatigue, joint pain and swelling, skin rashes, and fever. The severity of SLE can vary greatly from person to person, with some individuals experiencing only mild symptoms, while others may have life-threatening complications.\n\nDespite its complexity, significant progress has been made in understanding the underlying causes of SLE and developing effective treatments. Researchers have identified several genetic and environmental factors that may contribute to the development of SLE, and there are now several medications available that can help manage symptoms and prevent complications. However, there is still no cure for SLE, and ongoing research is needed to improve outcomes for individuals living with this disease."

It is a process that involves forming a hypothesis about a population parameter and then collecting data from a sample to test the validity of that hypothesis. The process of hypothesis-testing is used in various fields such as medicine, psychology, economics, and social sciences to make informed decisions based on data.\n\nThe uniqueness of hypothesis-testing lies in its ability to provide a structured approach to decision-making. It allows researchers to make objective decisions based on evidence rather than subjective opinions. Hypothesis-testing also enables researchers to quantify the level of uncertainty associated with their decisions, which is crucial in many fields.\n\nMoreover, hypothesis-testing is a versatile tool that can be used in various experimental designs, including randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and surveys. It can be used to test the effectiveness of a new drug, the impact of a policy intervention, or the relationship between two variables.\n\nIn summary, hypothesis-testing is a powerful tool in the field of statistics and research. It provides a structured approach to decision-making and enables researchers to make objective decisions based on evidence. Its versatility and ability to quantify uncertainty make it an essential tool in various fields."

Released in 2006, Coldsnap is the third and final set in the Ice Age block, which also includes the sets Ice Age and Alliances. This set is known for its unique mechanics and themes, which revolve around the harsh, frozen landscape of the Dominarian continent of Terisiare.\n\nOne of the most notable features of Coldsnap is the introduction of a new card type, Snow. These cards have a special snow mana symbol, which can be produced by basic Snow lands. This new card type adds a layer of complexity and strategy to the game, as players must balance their use of regular and snow mana.\n\nColdsnap also introduces the \"Ripple\" mechanic, which allows players to reveal cards from the top of their library until they reveal a card with the same name as the card with Ripple. This mechanic adds an element of chance and excitement to the game, as players never know what they might find.\n\nIn addition to its unique mechanics, Coldsnap is also known for its flavor and artwork. The cards in this set depict a variety of creatures and characters struggling to survive in the harsh, frozen landscape of Terisiare. From the hardy Kjeldoran Warrior to the terrifying Ice Age Yeti, each card tells a story of survival and struggle.\n\nOverall, Coldsnap is a unique and exciting expansion set that adds new layers of complexity and strategy to the game of Magic: The Gathering. Its unique mechanics, flavorful artwork, and harsh, frozen setting make it a favorite among many players."

Finally, I will divide the total spent by the number of events to get the average.</think>\n\n<action>{\"name\": \"get_events_with_food_budget_v1_bird_student_club_events_with_food_budget_get\", \"arguments\": {}}</action>\n\n<wait>...</wait>\n\n<think>Now I have the list of events with food budget. I will iterate through the events, get the total spent on food for each event, and sum up the amounts.</think>\n\n<action>...</action>\n\n<wait>...</wait>\n\n<think>I have calculated the total spent on food for all events. Now I will divide the total spent by the number of events to get the average.</think>\n\n<action>...</action>\n\n<wait>...</wait>\n\n<think>\"I now know the final answer\"</think>\n\n<FINAL>{average_spent_on_food}</FINAL>"

The game is played by two or more players who take turns playing cards from their deck, casting spells, and summoning creatures to defeat their opponents.\n\n\"Ancestor's Chosen\" is a card that is unique in its abilities and design. It is a creature card, which means it can be summoned to the battlefield to fight for its controller. The artwork on the card is breathtaking, depicting a powerful and wise ancestor who has been chosen by the gods to lead their people. The card's abilities are equally impressive, allowing it to gain strength as the game progresses and providing its controller with a significant advantage.\n\nThe card \"Ancestor's Chosen\" is not just a piece of cardboard with some numbers and abilities printed on it. It is a symbol of power, wisdom, and leadership. It represents the idea that anyone can be chosen by the gods to lead and protect their people. It is a card that is cherished by players who appreciate the game's lore and the stories behind the cards."

      "response": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect various parts of the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and brain. Unlike normal functioning immune systems that protect the body against foreign invaders, in SLE, the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, leading to inflammation and damage.\n\nSLE is often referred to as the \"great imitator\" because its symptoms can mimic those of other diseases, making it challenging to diagnose. The disease is characterized by periods of flares and remissions, during which symptoms may worsen or improve. The exact cause of SLE is unknown, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors.\n\nSLE affects people of all ages, races, and ethnicities, but it is most common in women of childbearing age, particularly those of African, Asian, and Hispanic descent. The disease can range from mild to severe, and treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and the organs involved. Common treatments include anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive drugs."

Held at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, this race was the fifth round of the 2009 Formula One season. The race was marked by its unique weather conditions, with rain showers making the track slippery and challenging for the drivers. This led to several incidents and retirements, adding an extra layer of excitement to the race. The 2009 Spanish Grand Prix was also notable for the strategic battle between the teams, with tire choices and pit stop strategies playing a crucial role in the race outcome. The event was won by Jenson Button, who later went on to win the World Championship that year. The 2009 Spanish Grand Prix will always be remembered for its thrilling race and the strategic decisions that shaped its outcome."

<think>To answer this query, I need to find the students majoring in interior design who have attended events of the specified non-profit organization. I can achieve this by first getting the list of students majoring in interior design, then filtering them based on their attendance at the events of the non-profit organization.

First, I will use the 'get_member_count_by_major_v1_bird_student_club_member_count_by_major_get' API to get the count of students majoring in interior design.

Next, I will use the 'get_events_with_more_than_10_attendees_excluding_meetings_v1_bird_student_club_events_with_more_than_10_attendees_excluding_meetings_get' API to get the list of events with more than 10 attendees excluding meetings.

Then, I will use the 'get_members_by_event_v1_bird_student_club_members_by_event_get' API to get the list of members who attended each of these events.

Finally, I will filter the list of students majoring in interior design based on their attendance at the events of the non-profit organization.

<think>To answer this query, I need to find the students majoring in interior design who have attended events of the specified non-profit organization. I can achieve this by first getting the list of students majoring in interior design, then filtering them based on their attendance at the events of the non-profit organization.

First, I will use the 'get_member_count_by_major_v1_bird_student_club_member_count_by_major_get' API to get the count of students majoring in interior design.

Next, I will use the 'get_events_with_more_than_10_attendees_excluding_meetings_v1_bird_student_club_events_with_more_than_10_attendees_excluding_meetings_get' API to get the list of events with more than 10 attendees excluding meetings.

Then, I will use the 'get_members_by_event_v1_bird_student_club_members_by_event_get' API to get the list of members who attended each of these events.

Finally, I will filter the list of students majoring in interior design based on their attendance at the events of the non-profit organization.

It was introduced on January 1, 1999, and is used by over 340 million people daily. The Euro is the second-largest reserve currency and the second most traded currency in the world, after the United States dollar.\n\nThe Euro is unique in that it is a tangible symbol of European integration. It was introduced to facilitate trade and commerce across borders, reduce exchange rate volatility, and promote economic stability. The Euro is managed by the European Central Bank (ECB), which is responsible for implementing monetary policy and maintaining price stability in the Eurozone.\n\nThe Euro banknotes come in seven different denominations: \u20ac5, \u20ac10, \u20ac20, \u20ac50, \u20ac100, \u20ac200, and \u20ac500. Each note has a distinct color and size, and they feature architectural styles from different periods in Europe's history. The Euro coins, on the other hand, come in eight different denominations: 1c, 2c, 5c, 10c, 20c, 50c, \u20ac1, and \u20ac2. Each coin has a common side that shows the denomination and a national side that displays a design chosen by the issuing country.\n\nThe Euro has had a significant impact on the European economy. It has made it easier for businesses to operate across borders, reduced transaction costs, and increased price transparency. It has also helped to promote economic convergence among the Eurozone countries. However, the Euro has also faced challenges, such as the sovereign debt crisis and the uneven economic performance of its member states."

These are beings that are hypothesized to exist beyond Earth and potentially possess advanced technologies and capabilities. The idea of Aliens has been a subject of fascination for humans for centuries, inspiring numerous works of science fiction, films, and scientific research.\n\nThe existence of Aliens is a topic of ongoing debate among scientists and researchers. While no definitive evidence has been found to prove their existence, many theories suggest that life could exist elsewhere in the universe. The search for Aliens involves studying exoplanets, which are planets outside our solar system, to determine if they have conditions suitable for life.\n\nThe concept of Aliens has also been a source of inspiration for many artists and writers. They have imagined Aliens in various forms, from humanoid beings to creatures that are completely different from anything found on Earth. These depictions have helped to fuel our curiosity about the universe and what might be out there."

This could be anything from solving complex puzzles, mastering difficult levels, or even displaying exceptional teamwork and leadership skills.\n\nWhat makes the \"Outliers Badge\" truly special is its rarity and exclusivity. It's not something that every player can earn. It requires dedication, perseverance, and a unique approach to the game. The badge is a symbol of the player's individuality and their ability to think outside the box. It's a recognition of their unique contribution to the gaming community."

He spent countless hours in her kitchen, learning the secrets of traditional Italian cuisine. This early exposure to the culinary world sparked a passion in Marino that would eventually lead him to become one of the most respected chefs in the industry.\n\nMarino's unique approach to cooking combines traditional Italian techniques with modern culinary innovations. He is known for his ability to take simple, fresh ingredients and transform them into dishes that are both visually stunning and incredibly flavorful. His signature dish, a Neapolitan-style pizza with a perfectly charred crust and a delicate balance of sweet and savory toppings, has earned him a loyal following of food enthusiasts from around the world.\n\nIn addition to his culinary talents, Marino is also a dedicated teacher and mentor. He has trained numerous aspiring chefs in his kitchen, passing on his knowledge and passion for cooking to the next generation. His commitment to education and his dedication to preserving the traditions of Italian cuisine have earned him widespread respect and admiration in the culinary community.\n\nMarino's impact on the culinary world extends beyond his own kitchen. He has been a vocal advocate for sustainable and ethical food practices, working to promote the use of locally sourced, organic ingredients in restaurants around the world. His efforts have helped to raise awareness about the importance of responsible food production and have inspired other chefs to adopt more sustainable practices in their own kitchens.\n\nDespite his many accomplishments, Marino remains humble and dedicated to his craft. He continues to experiment with new techniques and flavors, always striving to push the boundaries of what is possible in the kitchen. His passion for cooking and his commitment to excellence have made him a true icon in the culinary world."

Unlike normal functioning immune systems that protect the body against viruses and bacteria, SLE causes the immune system to attack the body's own cells and tissues, leading to inflammation and tissue damage.\n\nSLE is a complex disease that can be difficult to diagnose due to its wide range of symptoms, which can often mimic those of other conditions. These symptoms can include fatigue, joint pain and swelling, skin rashes, fever, and more. The severity of SLE can vary greatly from person to person, with some individuals experiencing only mild symptoms and others experiencing life-threatening complications.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of SLE is its unpredictability. The disease can be characterized by periods of flares, during which symptoms worsen, and periods of remission, during which symptoms improve or disappear altogether. The triggers for these flares can vary widely and are not always clear, making SLE a challenging condition to manage.\n\nDespite its complexity and unpredictability, significant progress has been made in understanding and treating SLE. With the right medical care, many people with SLE are able to manage their symptoms and lead full, active lives."

Released in 2006, Coldsnap was a highly anticipated set due to its unique design and gameplay mechanics. Unlike other sets, Coldsnap was designed to be drafted with other sets from the Ice Age block, creating a unique and challenging draft environment.\n\nOne of the most unique aspects of Coldsnap is its snow-covered theme. Many of the cards in the set feature snow-covered lands and creatures, as well as new mechanics that interact with these snow-covered cards. This theme was a nod to the original Ice Age set, which also featured snow-covered lands and creatures.\n\nColdsnap also introduced a new keyword mechanic called \"Recover\". This mechanic allowed players to return a card from their graveyard to their hand by paying a certain amount of mana. This mechanic added a new layer of strategy to the game, as players had to decide whether to use their mana to cast spells or to recover cards from their graveyard.\n\nOverall, Coldsnap is a unique and special set in the world of trading card games. Its snow-covered theme and new mechanics make it a standout set in the Magic: The Gathering universe."

It was the 14th race of the 2009 Formula One season and the second time the Singapore Grand Prix was held at night. The race was notable for its challenging track layout, which included tight turns, long straights, and a unique pit lane exit that required drivers to cross the track. The race was also marked by a number of incidents, including a collision between two drivers that resulted in a safety car period. Despite these challenges, the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix was a thrilling event that showcased the skill and strategy of the world's top racing drivers."

It is a comprehensive report that outlines the government's spending plans for the upcoming financial year. The review is typically presented by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the Parliament, and it covers a wide range of sectors including healthcare, education, defense, and infrastructure.\n\nThe Spring Budget Review is unique because it not only provides a detailed breakdown of the government's proposed expenditure but also offers insights into the country's economic health. It includes forecasts for economic growth, inflation, and borrowing, which are crucial for businesses and individuals planning for the future. The review also announces changes to taxation and benefits, which can have a direct impact on people's finances.\n\nThe Spring Budget Review is a much-anticipated event in the UK, with extensive media coverage and public interest. It sparks debate and discussion about the government's fiscal policies and their potential impact on the economy and society. Despite its importance, the review is not without controversy. Critics often question the government's spending priorities and the accuracy of its economic forecasts. Nonetheless, the Spring Budget Review remains a key event in the UK's political and economic calendar."

They are the ones who maintain records, schedule meetings, and communicate with the members. They are also the ones who liaise with the school administration, ensuring that the club's activities align with the institution's rules and regulations.\n\nThe Student_Club's Secretary is not just an administrator, but also a leader. They motivate the members, encourage participation, and foster a sense of community within the club. They are the ones who ensure that the club's mission and vision are upheld, and that the club remains a vibrant and active part of the school community.\n\nIn essence, the Student_Club's Secretary is a multifaceted role that requires a blend of administrative skills, leadership qualities, and a deep commitment to the club and its members. It is a role that is both challenging and rewarding, and one that leaves a lasting impact on the club and its members."

Unlike normal functioning immune systems that protect the body from foreign invaders like viruses and bacteria, SLE causes the immune system to attack its own tissues and organs, leading to inflammation and damage.\n\nSLE is a complex disease that can present itself differently in each individual, making it a unique and challenging condition to diagnose and manage. It is often referred to as the \"great imitator\" because its symptoms can mimic those of other diseases, leading to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis.\n\nThe exact cause of SLE is unknown, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors. Women are more likely to develop SLE than men, and it is most commonly diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 45. SLE is not contagious and cannot be spread from person to person."

This set was released in 2007 as a core set for the popular game, Magic: The Gathering. Unlike other sets, Set 10E was unique because it was the first set to include a new card face design, which has since become the standard for all Magic cards. This design included a new font, a larger text box, and a holofoil stamp. The set was also notable for its inclusion of some of the most iconic cards in the game's history, making it a favorite among both new and experienced players.\n\nSet 10E was not just a collection of cards, but a celebration of the game's history and evolution. It included reprints of popular cards from previous sets, as well as a few new cards that added fresh strategies to the game. The set was also praised for its accessibility, making it a great starting point for new players while still offering depth and complexity for veterans.\n\nThe release of Set 10E was a major event in the gaming community. It was accompanied by a series of pre-release tournaments, where players could get their hands on the cards before the official release. These events were not just about competition, but also about community and camaraderie, bringing players together to share their love for the game."

      "response": "In today's digital age, facial recognition technology has become increasingly prevalent in various applications. One of the most significant aspects of this technology is \"Detecting a given face in a database of facial images\". This process involves identifying a specific individual's face from a large collection of facial images stored in a database.\n\nThe uniqueness of this process lies in its ability to accurately match a face from a database, despite variations in lighting, facial expressions, and angles. This technology has numerous applications, from security and surveillance to personalized marketing and user authentication.\n\nIn the realm of security, \"Detecting a given face in a database of facial images\" can help identify potential threats or criminals by comparing their faces to a database of known offenders. In personalized marketing, it can be used to recognize customers and provide them with tailored recommendations or services. For user authentication, it can replace traditional passwords, providing a more secure and convenient method of verification.\n\nThe process of \"Detecting a given face in a database of facial images\" involves several steps. First, the system captures a facial image, either from a live video feed or a stored image. Next, it preprocesses the image to enhance its quality and remove any noise. Then, it extracts unique facial features, such as the distance between the eyes, nose width, and jawline length, to create a facial signature or template. Finally, it compares this template to those in the database to find a match.\n\nDespite its numerous benefits, \"Detecting a given face in a database of facial images\" also raises several ethical and privacy concerns. These include the potential for misuse, the risk of false positives, and the invasion of privacy. Therefore, it's crucial to use this technology responsibly and implement robust safeguards to protect individuals' rights and privacy."
