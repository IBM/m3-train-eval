In 2019, he transferred to Sampdoria, becoming the first South Korean player to ever play for the club. Despite his small stature, standing at just 5'6\", Min has proven to be a formidable force on the field, with his quick footwork and precise finishing skills. He has been praised by coaches and teammates alike for his work ethic and dedication to the sport."

The card's artwork, created by artist Douglas Shuler, depicts a beautiful angel with white wings and a golden halo. The angel is holding a sword and shield, ready for battle.

The system simplifies the traditional Chinese characters by reducing the number of strokes and simplifying the forms of a large number of characters. This makes it easier to learn and write. Chinese Simplified is also used in the People's Republic of China's official documents and publications.

The disease is more common in people from the Middle East, Asia, and Japan, and it typically affects people in their 20s and 30s.

The exact cause of RA is unknown, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Symptoms of RA can vary from person to person, but they often include joint pain, stiffness, swelling, and fatigue.

This condition can occur in both superficial and deep veins, with the latter being more serious due to the risk of the clot dislodging and traveling to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. Symptoms of thrombophlebitis include pain, swelling, redness, and warmth in the affected area. Risk factors for developing thrombophlebitis include prolonged immobility, surgery, pregnancy, and certain medical conditions such as cancer and autoimmune disorders. Treatment for thrombophlebitis typically involves the use of blood thinners and compression stockings to prevent the formation of additional clots and reduce swelling. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the clot."
