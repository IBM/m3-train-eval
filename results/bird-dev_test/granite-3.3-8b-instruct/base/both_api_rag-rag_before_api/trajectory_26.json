Once I identify the set, I will use the API to get the card IDs for that set.\n\n3. Then, I will use another API to filter these cards based on their power, specifically looking for cards with a power of 5 or higher.\n\n4. Finally, I will calculate the percentage of these high-power cards relative to the total number of cards in the set.\n\nFor this task, I will use the following APIs:\n- `get_set_name_translation_by_id_v1_bird_card_games_set_name_translation_by_id_get` to find the set that introduced the \"snow\" supertype.\n- `get_cards_by_mana_cost_v1_bird_card_games_cards_by_mana_cost_get` to get card IDs for the identified set.\n- `get_count_by_power_v1_bird_card_games_cards_count_by_power_get` to count cards with a power of 5 or higher.\n- Perform the percentage calculation based on the counts obtained.\n\nLet's start by identifying the set that introduced the \"snow\" supertype.</think><think>To identify the Magic: The Gathering set that introduced the \"snow\" supertype, I will use the `get_set_name_translation_by_id_v1_bird_card_games_set_name_translation_by_id_get` API.
