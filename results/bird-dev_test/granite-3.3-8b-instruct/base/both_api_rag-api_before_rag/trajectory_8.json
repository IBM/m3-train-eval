Use `get_finishing_average_by_height_v1` to find the player with the highest average finishing rate between the tallest and shortest players.\n2. Use `get_player_attributes_v1` to get the player's attributes, including their finishing attribute, to confirm the average finishing rate.\n3. Use `get_player_by_names_and_birthday_v1` to find the player's name and birthday, which will help in identifying the year of their highest average finishing rate.\n4. Use `get_player_count_by_weight_and_foot_v1` to find the player's preferred foot, which is necessary for narrowing down the player.\n5.
