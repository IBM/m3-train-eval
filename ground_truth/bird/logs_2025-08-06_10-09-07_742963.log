 Thought_1: The first step is to identify the shipping method that is preferred by customers the most. This information is crucial to answering the user's query about the cost difference between the most preferred shipping method and the Express shipping method. The tool "get_most_used_shipping_method_v1_books_most_used_shipping_method_get" is designed to provide this information. Since no specific arguments are required for this tool, it can be called with an empty argument field.

Thought_2: After identifying the most preferred shipping method, the next step is to find out the cost difference between this method and the Express shipping method. The tool "get_shipping_cost_difference_v1_books_shipping_cost_difference_get" is designed for this purpose. The tool call does not require any arguments as it is pre-programmed to compare the costs of Priority and Express shipping methods. The response from this tool will provide the cost difference, which directly answers the user's query.

 Thought_1: The first step is to determine the most preferred shipping method by customers. This information is necessary to identify which shipping method Marcelia Goering used the most in 2021. The tool "get_most_used_shipping_method_v1_books_most_used_shipping_method_get" is designed to provide this information, and it is called with no arguments as it does not require any.

Thought_2: After identifying the most preferred shipping method, the next step is to find out how many orders Marcelia Goering placed in 2021 using this method. The tool "get_count_orders_by_customer_shipping_method_year_v1_books_count_orders_by_customer_shipping_method_year_get" is designed for this purpose. The arguments for this tool call are determined based on the previous step's outcome and the current user query. The first name is "Marcelia", the last name is "Goering", the year is "2021", and the method name is "Priority", which was the most used shipping method found in the first step.

 Thought_1: The first step is to determine the year with the most customer orders. This is necessary to answer the user's query about the percentage of orders in the year with the most customer orders that used international shipping. The tool "get_year_with_most_orders_v1_books_year_with_most_orders_get" is designed to provide this information, and it is called with no arguments as it is designed to return the year with the most orders by default.

Thought_2: The second step is to find out the percentage of orders in the year identified in the first step that used international shipping. This is a direct follow-up to the first step and is necessary to fully answer the user's query. The tool "get_percentage_orders_by_shipping_method_and_year_v1_books_percentage_orders_by_shipping_method_and_year_get" is used for this purpose. The arguments for this tool call are determined based on the outcome of the first step and the user's query: the "method_name" is set to "International" as per the user's interest in international shipping, and the "year" is set to "2020" based on the result of the first step.

 Thought_1: The first step is to identify the shipping method ordered by Nicolette Sadler at the specified date and time. This is necessary to answer the user's query about the cost difference between the ordered shipping method and the Express shipping method. The tool description indicates that the tool can provide the shipping method based on customer first name, last name, and order date. The arguments for the tool call are determined directly from the user's query.

Thought_2: The second step is to identify the cost difference between the Priority and Express shipping methods. This is necessary to answer the user's query about the cost difference. The tool description indicates that the tool can provide the cost difference between these two shipping methods. The arguments for this tool call are empty because the tool does not require any input to provide the cost difference between the Priority and Express shipping methods.

 Thought_1: The user is asking for books published by Alfaguara in the same language as 'El plan infinito'. To answer this, we first need to determine the language of 'El plan infinito'. The tool 'get_language_name_by_book_title_v1_books_language_name_by_book_title_get' is designed to provide the language of a book based on its title. Therefore, we will use this tool with the argument 'title' set to 'El plan infinito' to find out the language of this book.

Thought_2: Now that we know 'El plan infinito' is written in Spanish, we can proceed to find all the titles of the books published by Alfaguara in Spanish. The tool 'get_titles_by_language_and_publisher_v1_books_titles_by_language_and_publisher_get' is designed to provide book titles based on language and publisher. Therefore, we will use this tool with the arguments 'language_name' set to 'Spanish' and 'publisher_name' set to 'Alfaguara' to find the titles of the books that meet these criteria.

 Thought_1: The first step is to determine the language in which 'El plan infinito' is written. This is necessary because the ISBN of a book is often associated with the specific edition, which can vary based on the language. The tool 'get_language_name_by_book_title_v1_books_language_name_by_book_title_get' is designed to provide this information. The argument 'title' is set to 'El plan infinito' to specify the book we are interested in.

Thought_2: After identifying the language of the book, the next step is to find the ISBN of the book published in that language. The tool 'get_isbn13_by_language_v1_books_isbn13_by_language_get' is used for this purpose. The argument 'language_name' is set to 'Spanish', which was the output from the first step. This will provide a list of ISBNs for books published in Spanish, which may include 'El plan infinito'.
