    "text": "\n**document**\nIn the world of football, the term \"medium\" is often used to describe the work rate of a player. However, it can also refer to the way a team sets up their formation on the field. A medium formation is one that balances both defensive and offensive strategies. It is a popular choice among many football managers due to its flexibility and adaptability.\n\nOne example of a team that uses a medium formation is the Italian club, Juventus. They often employ a 4-3-3 formation, which consists of four defenders, three midfielders, and three forwards. This formation allows them to maintain a solid defense while also creating opportunities for their attackers. The midfielders play a crucial role in this formation, as they are responsible for both supporting the defense and providing assists to the forwards.\n\nThe success of a medium formation depends on the players' ability to work together as a team. Each player must understand their role and responsibilities within the formation. They must also be able to adapt to different situations that may arise during a match. For instance, if the opposing team is dominating possession, the team may need to switch to a more defensive formation. Conversely, if they are trailing late in the game, they may need to push more players forward in an attempt to score.\n\nIn conclusion, a medium formation is a versatile strategy that can be effective in a variety of situations. It requires a team that is well-organized and disciplined, with players who are capable of fulfilling their roles and adapting to different scenarios.",

Query: What is the source of the immense power of the heaviest superhero in DC Comics?
Golden Answer: The source of Darkseid's immense power in DC Comics is a mysterious energy source known as the Omega Force. This force grants him superhuman strength, speed, and durability.
Agent Final Answer: (Darkseid's immense power comes from his natural abilities as a New God, which include superhuman strength, speed, and durability, as well as the ability to manipulate energy and matter. He also possesses the Omega Effect, a powerful energy beam that can destroy or transform matter, and is used for teleportation and manipulation of reality. Darkseid's power is further enhanced by his control over the planet Apokolips and its resources, as well as his army of Parademons.)

Despite his small stature, standing at just 5'6\", Min has proven to be a formidable force on the field, with his quick footwork and precise finishing skills.

It was introduced in the 1950s and 1960s as part of a language reform to increase literacy rates in China. The system simplifies the traditional Chinese characters by reducing the number of strokes and simplifying the forms of a large number of characters. This makes it easier to learn and write. Chinese Simplified is also used in the People's Republic of China's official documents and publications. Despite its name, Chinese Simplified is not a language itself, but a writing system used to write the Chinese language."

Symptoms of Behcet's disease can vary widely and may include mouth sores, genital sores, skin lesions, eye inflammation, and joint pain. The disease is most commonly diagnosed in people of Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, and Asian descent, and it is more common in men than women.

Symptoms of thrombophlebitis include pain, swelling, redness, and warmth in the affected area. Risk factors for developing thrombophlebitis include prolonged immobility, surgery, pregnancy, and certain medical conditions such as cancer and autoimmune disorders. Treatment for thrombophlebitis typically involves the use of blood thinners and compression stockings to prevent the formation of additional clots and reduce swelling.

Given that we've already attempted to retrieve the ability of a card with a high mana cost, it seems we need to adjust our approach to find the card with the highest mana cost in the specified set. To do this, I will first make an API call to get the name of the card in the set 'Journey into Nyx Hero's Path' with the highest mana cost. Once I have the name, I will then make another API call to determine its ability.</think><Action>{\"name\": \"get_card_name_v1_bird_card_games_card_name_get\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\"set_name\\\": \\\"Journey into Nyx Hero's Path\\\"}\"}</Action>",
