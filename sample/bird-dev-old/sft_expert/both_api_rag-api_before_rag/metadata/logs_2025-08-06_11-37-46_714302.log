However, it can also refer to the way a team sets up their formation on the field. A medium formation is one that balances both defensive and offensive strategies. It is a popular choice among many football managers due to its flexibility and adaptability.\n\nOne example of a team that uses a medium formation is the Italian club, Juventus. They often employ a 4-3-3 formation, which consists of four defenders, three midfielders, and three forwards. This formation allows them to maintain a solid defense while also creating opportunities for their attackers. The midfielders play a crucial role in this formation, as they are responsible for both supporting the defense and providing assists to the forwards.\n\nThe success of a medium formation depends on the players' ability to work together as a team. Each player must understand their role and responsibilities within the formation. They must also be able to adapt to different situations that may arise during a match. For instance, if the opposing team is dominating possession, the team may need to switch to a more defensive formation. Conversely, if they are trailing late in the game, they may need to push more players forward in an attempt to score.\n\nIn conclusion, a medium formation is a versatile strategy that can be effective in a variety of situations. It requires a team that is well-organized and disciplined, with players who are capable of fulfilling their roles and adapting to different scenarios.",

Query: What is the primary role of the least numerous element in non-carcinogenic molecules in living organisms?
Golden Answer: The primary role of 'Ca' in living organisms is in cell physiology, where movement of the calcium ion Ca2+ into and out of the cytoplasm functions as a signal for many cellular processes. It is also a major material used in mineralization of bone, teeth and shells, making it the most abundant metal by mass in many animals.
Agent Final Answer: (The primary role of 'Ca' in living organisms is in cell physiology, where movement of the calcium ion Ca2+ into and out of the cytoplasm functions as a signal for many cellular processes. It is also a major material used in mineralization of bone, teeth and shells, making it the most abundant metal by mass in many animals.)
